                    With some programming skills, platforms you already use like Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 can have a lot of functionality that you may not be aware of. How many tools do you have that don't talk to each other? 
                    How often do you wish your platforms would do more for you? If it's working but you're not happy with it, then integration and automation could be your next move.

                    Generic IT services don't understand the unique pressures of an Allied Health practice. They don't see the effects of
                    the compliance burden, the NDIS billing headaches, and therapists managing a type of work that they never signed up for.
